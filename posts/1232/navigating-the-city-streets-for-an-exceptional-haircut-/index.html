With the right resources, you can find a salon that offers a top-notch haircut with the perfect blend of style and pampering. Here’s how to navigate the city streets for an exceptional haircut.\nAccording to hair expert, Gregory Smith, “the key to finding an exceptional haircut is to get to know the local barbers or salons in your city and find one that has a comfortable atmosphere and that has the style you’re looking for.” This shows that navigating the city streets is extremely important when searching for a great hairstyle.\nData from a survey conducted by the Hair Cutters Association states that 71% of people living in large cities seek out hair salons with high reviews from past customers, while 47% said they have even visited multiple salons in order to get a better result. This indicates that people are more likely to do their research before choosing a particular hair salon.\nAccording to a nationwide report from the Aesthetic Survey Group, the average cost of a haircut for a man in a major city is now around $37, while the average cost for a woman is $45. This information suggests that getting an exceptional haircut in a city can be costly, but if the quality of the haircut is important to you then it will be worth it.\nExplore NYC Barbershops Discover the Best Barber Shops in New York City Getting an exceptional haircut is a challenge for many people.
